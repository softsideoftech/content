A few weeks ago I shared the story of [how I made one crappy decision after another](/startup-humiliation) while working with my first co-founder right out of college. I was miserable for nearly a year and a half and I couldn't tell you why I did it. 

I was surprised every time that I acted against my own interest. _What had just happened?_ It's as if someone else who didn't really know me or understand what I truly cared about took over my body and clumsily tried to help. What were they thinking?

It sounds like a definition of 'crazy', but as I've been reflecting on my time with Denis, I've started to realize that some parts of my personality really would act independently of my whole being. It was all too messy for me to sort through just by thinking about it, so I wrote about it instead. 

Here is the story of [how one fragment of my personality repeatedly took over and left me with the mess.](https://softsideoftech.com/personality-parts)
