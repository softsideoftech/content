They say that when we fall madly in love, we're not in love with a real person. We're infatuated with our idea of that person.

If there are any qualities that we lack in ourselves (joy, self-worth, strength, etc.) we project them onto our object of affection. Somehow that other person makes us feel complete, as impossible as that might be.

For a while, we're blind to our lover's flaws and imperfections. Whatever part of us that tends to judge and criticize--even if it's just secretly in our heads--stays quiet.

But after some time, we start to notice cracks in our ideal image of the other person. We might notice a habit or two that we find annoying. Perhaps we discover this person disagrees with a value that we hold dear. 

And we wonder: _How did I ever miss this? If only I knew!_

But we couldn't have known. We're evolutionarily wired to fall into romantic love. Our genetic programming gives us this temporary hallucination for its own ends. 

> _Our imaginative drive is so powerful, there's little we can do to be fully in touch with our reality._

It turns out that this is true for other types of experiences, too. I've often talked of a "honeymoon period" when someone first joins a company. I've seen it last three to six months for most people. And I'm no different.

When I first joined my last startup, I had created an idealistic image of how wonderful the company could be. Those ideals blinded me and led me to make mistakes at my job. These mistakes contributed to the company needing to get acquired two years later because we weren't able to succeed as an independent business. 

This is the story of **[my honeymoon at Clara Lending](https://softsideoftech.com/corporate-honeymoon)**.

With love,
