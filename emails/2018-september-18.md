Stacya and I felt nostalgic for San Francisco this morning. She mentioned a bakery she loved in the Dog Patch. That reminded me of how much I loved taking the girls rock climbing at Dog Patch Boulders.

It's bittersweet for me to admit that we are permanently saying goodbye to the city we spent most of our adult lives in. 

As of today, we've put our [SF condo on the market](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3590-20th-St-APT-502-San-Francisco-CA-94110/2094197350_zpid/?fullpage=true) as we'll probably never be able to afford to live in it again.

Last week I shared a story of how I insisted on using a [feedback product that my team didn't want](https://softsideoftech.com/undermining-myself). Some of you rightly pointed out that it wasn't that big of a deal in the greater scheme of things.

And yet it bothered me so much. I felt ashamed for months because I thought I had embarrassed myself as a leader. _I should have known better_. 

In fact, I did know. That's why my inner critic beat me up so much.

So at my next job, at Clara Lending, I tried hard to actually _be better_. 

[Here's the story of how I tried to manage with more openness and acceptance than ever before](https://softsideoftech.com/buy-in-and-alignment).

P.S. Since my girls started back at school, I've been working on a course for cultivating your leadership potential from within. 

It's a serious _inner work_ course for people in tech. 

I'm going to beta test the content with a few friends next month. Shoot me a note if you'd like to test it out. I could use the honest feedback. I have room for maybe 3-4 more people.
