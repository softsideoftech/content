Hi guys,

The eleven of you are now classmates. And I'm on the journey with you, both as your guide and fellow inner work student. The next three months will be an adventure for us all.

First, some logistics. I'll be sharing two course videos a week starting next week. In the second week, we're going to have our first live session as a group. 

Please tell me what days/times you're able to make in the link bellow and I will try to accommodate everyone. 

[Share your availability here](https://doodle.com/poll/dgzexbhkcuse3tim)

The twelve of us span 4 timezones across the world, so there is a good chance we will break into two groups for the first and all subsequent sessions depending on what times you're all available.

_**Relationship**_  
Let's use the rest of this email thread to deepen our relationships with each other. We're going to depend on the support from one another to get through these next three months. By the end, I hope that we all reveal a little more of our innate leadership gifts to the world.

_**Integrity**_  
If we're going to explore ourselves deeply together, we need to feel completely safe with one another. I ask that we all make two commitments to each other. One is to be as open and honest as we are consciously able to, both in groups and in one-on-one interaction. And two is to maintain strict confidentiality about what is said or done by anyone in the group, even from your significant other. 

If you feel you have to say something, it's ok to share a generic story like "someone talked about their family struggles today". It's _not ok_ to share anything specific like "Bob talked about a fight he had with his wife". If you're not sure what's ok, shoot me a quick message and I'll clarify.

_**Sharing**_  
Let's start developing our relationships by sharing something about ourselves with the following 3 questions as our guide.

1. What city do you live and work in and what is your timezone?
2. Why are you doing this?
3. What's going on for you right now in your life? _(eg. key events, emotions, thoughts)_
4. What are you hoping to get out of this? What might change for you? How could your daily experience be different?



Please _reply-to-all_ with your own responses by **this Friday**. We're going to be forming buddy-pairs and pod-groups next week and this email is a pre-requisite for that step.

With love,  
Vlad

P.S. I'm in this with you, so I'll answer these questions first:

1. I live and work in Utrecht, Netherlands, which is in CET (UTC+1). 
2. I got the urge to create this course over the summer. I was on vacation and staying at someone's Airbnb cottage in a nearby town. I sat on a bench in the back yard reading an article in the New York times about how China was throwing hundreds of thousands of Muslims into "re-education" camps.<br/><br/>I felt personally hurt, particularly the part of me that identifies as an Eastern European Jew. I felt powerless to do anything about it. I stayed with that feeling of powerlessness as I thought about how so many people in our world can't empathize for anyone that isn't part of their "clan". This is painfully true in America, too.<br/><br/>That's when my inspiration struck me. _I can do something._ I'm _already_ doing something through my work as a coach. I was helping people realize their deeper potential, a part of which was a greater appreciate for all human beings. It just didn't feel like enough. I wanted to reach more people, particularly people with ambition and leadership potential, people who could make a difference in their small part of the world.<br/><br/>That's where you come in :)
3. I've been alternating a lot between different extremes. Some days (or hours) I feel inspired and energized. Other days I have this sense of meaninglessness  in my life. And I wonder, what's the point? Why am doing any of this? Is it simply to satisfy my own selfish needs and desires?<br/><br/>In my relationship with my wife, Stacya, I have very different days. Often we feel connected and loving. But sometimes, pretty regularly, I feel frustrated, angry, even hateful towards her. The pain of those moments can be overwhelming. Often I find myself tensing up and repressing feelings to avoid that pain.
4. A part of me hopes to find a sense of purpose in doing this work for you. And I also need money to live. So I'm hoping that aspect of my life will get easier if this course is successful, though I have no idea what that would look like. Mostly, I think I just want to wake up every day and "know what I need to do", both to take care of my family and to do my part for the world.

P.P.S Don't feel obligated to write a long-ish response like I did. I'd rather that you say something sooner than put this off. You can always share more via our future interactions.
