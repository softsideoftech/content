Hi {{.FirstName}},

Thank you for your support, even just the virtual variety. I've been living in The Netherlands for a year now. My two girls are now fluent in Dutch and just started going to a local Montessori elementary school.

The year has been hard for me at times, but fulfilling. 

Sometime over the summer, I finally started to feel like I'm getting the hang of this coaching thing. It's been both a relief and a source of excitement for me.

I've decided to take what I've learned about leadership development and my own inner work and turn it into a _**distributed course.**_

More on that later!

For now, I'm sharing a reflection of how I used to constantly mess up as a leader. One story in particular stuck out for me from my time at Workday. Three years ago, I made a mistake that shaped my management style ever since.

This is the story of how [I forced an idea on my team and undermined myself](https://softsideoftech.com/undermining-myself).

With love,  
Vlad

P.S. I'd love you hear your stories about your leadership mistakes. You can reply to this email with whatever episode comes to mind for you. 

I promise no judgement and an open heart.
