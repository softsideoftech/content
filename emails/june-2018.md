In April, I had shared how my secret motivations [drove me to reevaluate my life](https://softsideoftech.com/motivation-at-clara). I felt that my Silicon Valley lifestyle was mostly meaningless, and I wanted a radical change. So I did it. Last August my family and I left everything we had in San Francscio--private schools, expensive condo, my tech job--and moved to Holland. 

I thought we would be happy. I thought that having few responsibilities and travling around Europe would feel liberating and exciting. And it was, some of the time. But there's this saying I've heard from people doing inner work: "whereever you go, there you are".

It turned out that leaving everything behind took away all the noise in my life and I was able to see just who I was for the first time, and I didn't like what came up for me. I suddenly found myself acting like the sensitive, hurt, little boy that I once was. A little boy I had thought was long gone. 

This is the story of [how I traded safety for meaning without realizing what it would cost me](https://softsideoftech.com/the-safety-bubble).

I had a hard time sharing my previous story back in April and I almost didn't write this one. Somehow life kept getting in the way. I'm grateful that so many of you had reached out to me after my previous email and offered your own thoughts or words of support. You inspired me to keep going. Thank you.

Warmly,  
Vlad
