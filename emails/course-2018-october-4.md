{{.FirstName}},

Here's the info I promised you on the inner leadership development course. 

_**If you still want to be in the course, please read through to the end of this email.**_

First, what do I mean by _Inner Leadership Development_?

This course is _**not**_ about developing new management skills.
 
Instead, you'll be getting in touch with the natural leadership capacities you already have. You will learn to listen to yourself more deeply and act from a place of greater authenticity. From that place, you'll more often be able to do what's best for you and everyone around you.

I call this _Inner Work_. And I begin to explain this in the first video of the course:

Please take 5 minutes to watch the video before you read the rest of the email.

If you're now more excited, rather than less, then take a look at the Course Logistics below.
  
  
**Core Material**  
 • _Course Length_: 3 months  
 • _Content_: Two 5-min videos each week   
 • _Live Sessions_: 1-hour video meeting with the whole class every two to three weeks @ mornings Pacific Time.  
 • _Self Practices_: 10-30 minutes _**each day**_ (5-10 min at home, 5-20 min at work)

_Your experience will be challenging and uncomfortable at times. You'll likely need the support of your fellow classmates to make it through._ 

**Support**  
 • _Me_: I'll be available throughout over email, phone and video. We'll officially schedule 3 one-hour check-in's over the 3 months.  
 • _Buddy_: You'll be paired with one other classmate for one-on-one support.  
 • _Pod_: You will also be in groups of 3-4 people as your private support community.  

I'll try to match you with people that live in your area so you could meet in person if you like. Though some of you may want/need to connect over phone/video calls.

You're free to meet as often or as little as you like. I would encourage you to connect at least once every two weeks. 

It will be hard to sustain the energy you need to keep up. The relationships that you'll develop with your classmates will help you persevere through it.

**Dates**  
 • The course will likely start on _**Tuesday November 6th**_ with the first video.  
 • We will do our first live group session the following week. I'll poll everyone in the group to determine the day/time that works best.

**Commitment**  
You'll be a pillar of support for 3-4 of your classmates. Please think about if you'll be able to be there for them for the full 3 months. You'll need to keep up with the material and practices along the way.

**Price**  
 • The beta is _free!_   
 • When I open up the course for others next year, it will likely be *$1,000*.   
 • Please treat the experience as if that is what you paid to participate.

IF YOU STILL WANT TO PARTICIPATE, PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL AND LET ME KNOW BY _**THIS FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12TH**_.

Hope to see you there.

With love,
