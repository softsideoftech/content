I don't have any new writing for you today. I had made a commitment to myself to share one essay a month for at least a year and a part of me is dissapointed to be missing this month. I was afraid I wouldn't have the energy this time, so I didn't try.

I've been putting my energy into creating a three-month long Inner Leadership Course. Eleven friends have volunteered to go on this journey with me. We're three weeks in and I'm grateful for how open, vulnerable and curious they've been.

I made a course video that resonated with them and I'd like to share it with you. It's my own rendition of a story called "The Island Where It All Turns Out."

I first heard it from Steve March, who was my teacher when I studied coaching at New Ventures West.

P.S. Lots of you asked for some family pictures a couple emails back, so here's a fall collage I made of the girls :)
