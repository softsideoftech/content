I recently had a call with a young engineer I once knew. He was in a bind and seeking advice. He had joined a startup early in its life and made a series of decisions that he was now seeing as mistakes. A big one being that when the startup was about to run out of cash, he personally loaned it money to keep it going. He wasn't one of the original founders and his ownership stake was modest. He ended up putting everything he had into it. And when he ran out of savings to give, the startup needed just a bit more. So he doubled down with credit cards. Now he's got a not-so-small fortune in debt and it's not clear what will come of it. 

As he was talking to me, I could sense my own discomfort in the background. I too once made a series of bad decisions at a startup and memories of those events were starting to sting again like a toxic vapor rising up from the depths of my subconscious.

In 2005, I tried starting a company with a former college roommate and it tuned out to be one of the most painful and humiliating experiences of my life. 

I'm revisiting these events after 13 years so I could finally find some growth and healing from them.
