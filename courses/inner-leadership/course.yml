  video: When we achieve a big personal goal, why do we only feel better for a short time? And why do we often feel worse afterward?

- name: Training For Inner Work
  url: meditation
  day: 1
  video: Meditation is not what you think it is. You're actually doing training in discomfort.
  email: Here's the first official video for the course and it introduces our first (and most foundational) practice. It's only 9 minutes long, so I'll let the video speak for itself.

- name: Find a Buddy
  day: 2
  email: |
    The inner-work journey is hard. The pain and challenge of it is unavoidable. That's why we need buddies. Someone that understands what we're going through. Someone that can be there for us without trying to "help" or "fix" us. Somehow, being _in relationship_ with another person makes our struggle more tollerable (though not any easier).  
    
    So it's time you find yourself a buddy. Someone you will support and who will support you in return for these next three month.
      
    Go ahead and reach out to one of you classmates. It's best you do it now.
      
    _And if you haven't already, today is a good day to share something about yourself with the group._
      
    You're a leaders with plenty of initiative, so I'm leaving it to you to find a buddy and setup recurring meetings. I recommend once every week or two so you could process some of the material together.
      
    Remember, this course is about your _**experience**_, not the material. The point is not to learn about some new ideas or skills, but to develop embodied understanding of who you are. Your relationship with your buddy and your experience of mutual support is an essencial part of that process.
      
    Once you've confirmed your buddy and scheduled your first meeting, please let me know here so I know that everyone has a match

    One last bit. Since we have an odd number of people, we need one of you to work with two buddies. If you feel you have the room in your life to support and be supported by an additional person, please respond to this email to let me know and I'll tell you how to proceed.

- name: Extra Help With Your Practice
  day: 4

    How's your meditation practice going? It's ok if you haven't been able to get into it. It's ok if you mind wanders the whole time. Whatever is coming up for you is always ok. 

    If you could use some extra guidance on how to actually do meditation or maybe some support getting started with, I recommend you checkout Headspace -
    https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app

    It's a simple app that's free for the first 10 lessons, which could be enough to get over the initial hump. Michelle, my 9-year-old, tried Headspace and was actually meditating on her own for a week. I hear it's pretty good for us adults too...

    If you haven't already, today's the day to find your buddy. Just look back at our group email thread from last week and reach out to someone. It really doesn't matter who. And if you haven't introduced yourself to the group, now would be a good time before we get any father into the course.

    I'm curious how this course is going for you. Let's do our first one on one next week. 
    
    This will be a space for you share your experience with me or ask me about anything that's coming up for you. We can go deeper into anything you want. Or I might notice something in you and we can explore it together.
    
    Use this link to schedule a time. It's on a first come-basis, so I encourage you to take a few minutes now to lock in a time:

- name: The Inner Critic
  url: inner-critic
  day: 8
  video: As children, this internal enforcer helped us cope with an adult world that we couldn't fully understand. As adults, it bullies us with the maturity of a 9-year-old. As leaders, it errodes people's sense of safety around us and undermines their trust in us.
  email: Today, we'll talk about an internal enforcer that tries to help us with our daily lives. When we were little children, it enabled us to cope with an adult world that we couldn't fully understand. Now that we're adults, it often bullies us with the maturity of a 9-year-old. And as leaders, it errodes people's sense of safety around us and, inevitably, undermines their trust in us.

    If the last video about the Inner Critic piqued your curiosity and you want to go deeper into the topic, I recommend you check out the book: [Soul Without Shame](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009GN3DD8/).

    I honestly didn't believe I had an Inner Critic before I read this book. Noticing mine for the first time was an excruciating experience. It actually acted up more than ever before. I had more fights with my wife. I had more frustration and anxiety around my boss. My life felt worse on many levels.

    And I don't regret it for a second.

    I had woken up to the world of constant comparison, expectations, assessment, judgment, etc that I had been living in--along with everyone around me. As harsh as it was, I preferred to see the painful truth of the world over living the lie of "the good life" and continuing to feel a kind of subtle emptiness, a hollowness, inside of me. 

    Even if you don't have the time or energy to go through the whole book, you might appreciate reading the first few chapters as that's when the realization hit me.

  video: I was having a bad moment when I recorded this. I decided to take ownership for how I felt and share my process with you.
  email: I recorded this video a few weeks ago while I was having a bad moment. Given the topic of the week (the Inner Critic), I thought the raw experience would be useful for you to see.

- name: Body Week
  day: 14
  email: |
    This week, we're going to start exploring our mind's relationship with our body. So just for today, reflect on what your body means to you. What does it feel like? And how do you feel _about it_?
  
    No need to reply to me. You don't even need to answer these questions explicity. Just hold the questions until you see tomorrow's video.
