  day: 0
  video: When we achieve a big personal goal, why do we only feel better for a short time? And why do we often feel worse afterward?

- name: Training For Inner Work
  url: meditation
  day: 1
  video: Meditation is not what you think it is. You're actually doing training in discomfort.
  email: Here's the first official video for the course and it introduces our first (and most foundational) practice. It's only 9 minutes long, so I'll let the video speak for itself.

- name: Find a Buddy
  day: 2
  email: |
    The inner-work journey is hard. The pain and challenge of it is unavoidable. That's why we need buddies. Someone that understands what we're going through. Someone that can be there for us without trying to "help" or "fix" us. Somehow, being _in relationship_ with another person makes our struggle more tollerable (though not any easier).  
    
    So it's time you find yourself a buddy. Someone you will support and who will support you in return for these next three month.
      
    Go ahead and reach out to one of you classmates. It's best you do it now.
      
    _And if you haven't already, today is a good day to share something about yourself with the group._
      
    You're a leaders with plenty of initiative, so I'm leaving it to you to find a buddy and setup recurring meetings. I recommend once every week or two so you could process some of the material together.
      
    Remember, this course is about your _**experience**_, not the material. The point is not to learn about some new ideas or skills, but to develop embodied understanding of who you are. Your relationship with your buddy and your experience of mutual support is an essencial part of that process.
      
    Once you've confirmed your buddy and scheduled your first meeting, please let me know here so I know that everyone has a match

    One last bit. Since we have an odd number of people, we need one of you to work with two buddies. If you feel you have the room in your life to support and be supported by an additional person, please respond to this email to let me know and I'll tell you how to proceed.

- name: Extra Help With Your Practice
  day: 4
  email: |
    How's your meditation practice going? It's ok if you haven't been able to get into it. It's ok if you mind wanders the whole time. Whatever is coming up for you is always ok. 

    If you could use some extra guidance on how to actually do meditation or maybe some support getting started with, I recommend you checkout Headspace -
    https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app

    It's a simple app that's free for the first 10 lessons, which could be enough to get over the initial hump. Michelle, my 9-year-old, tried Headspace and was actually meditating on her own for a week. I hear it's pretty good for us adults too...

- name: Weekend Catch Up
  day: 5
  email: |
    If you haven't already, today's the day to find your buddy. Just look back at our group email thread from last week and reach out to someone. It really doesn't matter who. And if you haven't introduced yourself to the group, now would be a good time before we get any father into the course.

- name: Our First One on One
  day: 7
  email: |
    I'm curious how this course is going for you. Let's do our first one on one next week. 
    
    This will be a space for you share your experience with me or ask me about anything that's coming up for you. We can go deeper into anything you want. Or I might notice something in you and we can explore it together.
    
    Use this link to schedule a time. It's on a first come-basis, so I encourage you to take a few minutes now to lock in a time:

- name: The Inner Critic
  url: inner-critic
  day: 8
  video: As children, this internal enforcer helped us cope with an adult world that we couldn't fully understand. As adults, it bullies us with the maturity of a 9-year-old. As leaders, it errodes people's sense of safety around us and undermines their trust in us.
  email: Today, we'll talk about an internal enforcer that tries to help us with our daily lives. When we were little children, it enabled us to cope with an adult world that we couldn't fully understand. Now that we're adults, it often bullies us with the maturity of a 9-year-old. And as leaders, it errodes people's sense of safety around us and, inevitably, undermines their trust in us.

- name: Soul Without Shame
  day: 9
  email: |
    If the last video about the Inner Critic piqued your curiosity and you want to go deeper into the topic, I recommend you check out the book: [Soul Without Shame](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009GN3DD8/).

    I honestly didn't believe I had an Inner Critic before I read this book. Noticing mine for the first time was an excruciating experience. It actually acted up more than ever before. I had more fights with my wife. I had more frustration and anxiety around my boss. My life felt worse on many levels.

    And I don't regret it for a second.

    I had woken up to the world of constant comparison, expectations, assessment, judgment, etc that I had been living in--along with everyone around me. As harsh as it was, I preferred to see the painful truth of the world over living the lie of "the good life" and continuing to feel a kind of subtle emptiness, a hollowness, inside of me. 

    Even if you don't have the time or energy to go through the whole book, you might appreciate reading the first few chapters as that's when the realization hit me.

  video: I was having a bad moment when I recorded this. I decided to take ownership for how I felt and share my process with you.
  email: I recorded this video a few weeks ago while I was having a bad moment. Given the topic of the week (the Inner Critic), I thought the raw experience would be useful for you to see.

- name: (Live Recording) 1st Group Call
  url: first-group-call
  day: 12
  video: This was our first live group session. We talked about challenges with meditation, skepticism going into the course, the _"what the hell"_ effect and addiction, hearing/seeing others, our shared sense of struggle, and more.

    Here's the recording of our first live session from yesterday. 
    
    We talked about challenges with meditation, skepticism going into the course, the _"what the hell"_ effect and addiction, hearing/seeing others, our shared sense of struggle and more.
    
    I was touched and inspired by the quality of our conversation.
    
    If you weren't there, you may want to block out an hour this weekend and take it all in. 

- name: Body Week
  day: 14
  email: |
    This week, we're going to start exploring our mind's relationship with our body. So just for today, reflect on what your body means to you. What does it feel like? And how do you feel _about it_?
  
    No need to reply to me. You don't even need to answer these questions explicity. Just hold the questions until you see tomorrow's video.

  day: 15
  video: Here is our second Inner Work fitness exercise. Like meditation, building up the capacity to sense our bodies is essencial to tapping into our leadership potential.
  email: Today, I'll share our second Inner Work "fitness exercise". Building up the capacity to sense our bodies will be essencial to tapping into our leadership potential.

- name: Dates For Our Group Sessions
  day: 16
  email: | 
    I have a purely logistical email for you today. I've set the dates for our five remaining group sessions. It seems everyone in the group can generally make the time of our last session, so all these sessions will be at the same time as that one, 3pm UTC. I'll try to avoid holidays. 
    
    All these sessions are on Thursdays, so please let me know if that day is generally a challenge for you or if you can't make any of these dates. 
    
    I will send the calendar invites out tomorrow morning my time.

- name: Body vs Mind

  day: 17
  video: We often experience the world as if our thinking mind is who we are and our body is it's tool to carry out our needs and desires. Is the brain really the operator and the body a machine? Or is there something deeper going on that we often miss?
  email: | 
    I'd like to share something that came as a surprise to me when I first realized it.
    
    We often experience the world as if our thinking mind is who we are and our body is it's tool to carry out our needs and desires. 
    
    But is the brain really the operator and the body a machine? Or is there something deeper going on that we often miss?

  video: |
    Here we begin to explore the question, "How do we decide what to do?" At its root, this question challenges us to declare what we're truly committed to.

    But we won't try to answer that right now. Instead, I'll introduce a prioritization exercise whose results you'll use later on in the course to explore this question for yourself.
  email: |
    I have to apologize for my break from emails over the past several days. I had some things scheduled for you, but I made a mistake and the emails didn't go out. I'm committing to doing better next time to maintain a smooth experience for you, at least with the technical bits that are more in my control.

    For today's video, we'll begin to explore the question, "How do we decide what to do?" At its root, this question challenges us to declare what we're truly committed to. 

    But we won't try to answer that right now. Instead, I'll introduce a prioritization exercise whose results you'll use later on in the course to explore this question for yourself.       
  
- name: Leadership Embodiment
  day: 24
  email: |
    If last week's videos piqued your curiosity, I can recommend a book that will broaden your exploration into the role our bodies play in our cognition. It's actually two books in one. 

    Part I guides you through physical/somatic techniques that you can use to influence the mood in a room of people, regain your emotional balance, and even hear others more empathetically.

    Part II tells the story of our evolutionary neuro-biology and helps us understand why our minds and bodies function the way that they do. If you're experiencing skepticism about the body's or nervous system's role in our thoughts or behavior, then you may want to read this part first. 

    The book is called [Leadership Embodiment](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GBJWX68/).

    As you're noticing your stories and inner voices, you might start to wonder where they come from and why they feel the way they do. You might feel frustrated or anxious about some of what comes up for you.

    How do you work with this? How can you go deeper to the root of the issues?

    Often, our conscious mind is locked out from our deeper inner world. So what can we do to open the gate?

    This week we'll make a shift from solely focusing on our inner experience to also exploring our relational world. To prepare for the week, start to think about the relationships in your life: your family members, co-workers, friends, and whoever else you feel connected to.
    
    You don't even have to do this conciously. Just hold the intention for today and see what comes up for you.

    A few people shared stories of how meditation has affected them in their day to day lives. We shared our struggles of engaging with the practices. We discussed how our desire for self improvement and freedom from stress can actually undermine our innner development process. And quite a bit more.

    Endre mentioned something in his check-out that struck me. He said he's learned a lot about his own thoughts and emotions just by hearing about everyone else's experiences. I think this is a valuable benefit of working in a group like we are. We have so much more in common than not. And when we hear about our classmate's struggles or inner learnings, we often notice those same things in ourselves.

    As we grew up, we often struggled with discomfort. We tried to either avoid stressful situations or calm ourselves down when we get too worked up. Eventually, we got pretty good at coping with it all. By accidental trial and error, we stumbled on strategies that worked for us.

    This video calls attention to all the self-soothing habbits that we acquired along the way.

    As I was growing up, I often struggled with my discomforts. For years, I tried to either avoid stressful situations or calm myself down when I got too worked up. By the time I was in my mid-twenties, I had gotten pretty good at coping with it all. 
    
    By accidental trial and error, I stumbled on strategies that worked for me. Perhaps you went through a similar process.

- name: Getting Our Bodies Back
  day: 37
  email: |
    If the last video on our additions to self-soothing got you thinking and you really want to explore it more deeply, I have a book for you. It's called [Getting Our Bodies Back](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EYGHN06/).
    
    It's written by Christine Caldwell, a body-centered psychotherapist. She used to work with alcoholics and other addicts, and now she also helps people with their every-day addictions. 

    Self-soothing can be far more subtle than the examples I gave in my last video. Christine shares far more of them in her book. She helped me realize many of my particular issues and showed me how I could work with them.

  day: 39

    I'd like to give you the chance go deeper into your inner work via one-on-one conversations. I'm making myself available for two sessions between now and the end of the course. With the holidays coming up, my availability for the next month is spotty and then opens up in mid-January.
    
    You may use this link to schedule time for us to meet:

    [https://calendly.com/softsideoftech/one-on-one-coaching/](https://calendly.com/softsideoftech/one-on-one-coaching/)
    
    Please be dillent about making the time that you schedule. I was surprised by how many people missed their appointments the last time around and I would like to avoid repeating that experience.
    
    I'm looking forward to connecting with you soon.

    If you're finding it a struggle to keep up with all the ideas and practices in the course, you're not alone. It takes immense Will to commit yourself to inner work. 
  
    But "true will" doesn't feel like effort. Unlike "efforting", which feels tense and leaves us feeling depleted, true will is relaxed and feels like it has an infinite reservoir.

  day: 43
  email: |
    If you haven't already, please share what your "aim" will be for the next two weeks. You can simply reply to this email. And try to be as precise as possible with whatever you decide.
  
    As a reminder, an aim is an intention that you will set for the next two weeks. It should be something that will make your life function better and be realistically achievable for you. This is _not_ a stretch goal.  
    
    I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

    We have our third group session tomorrow. Please reply right away if you think you might not make it (or know for sure that you won't).
    
    Today, we're revisting a topic that we've touched in passing a few times now: staying with our experience. When we struggle with discomfort, our instict is to make it go away. Our habbitual "survival" strategies kick in before our conscious mind knows what's happening, so we never have a chance to simply "be" with whatever is coming up for us.
    
    This video is about waking up to our usual pattern and developing a new habbit in its place.
