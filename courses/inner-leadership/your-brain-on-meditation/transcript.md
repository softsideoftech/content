# Your Brain On Meditation

Welcome back. 

Now I actually find the science of meditation interesting, so I'm going to share some of it with you. 

#### Regulating The Amygdala
There are two big changes that happen to your brain when you start meditating. The first happens in your amygdala. This is this tiny little portion of your brain that--evolutionary speaking--is the oldest part of your brain, sometimes called the lizard brain. 

When you see an image of something unpleasant, like people in pain, that's the part of your brain that activates. When you're about to get feedback from your boss that might not be particularly pleasant, that's the part of brain starts kicking in and you start feeling that anxiety, that fight or flight response. 

So what happens when people meditate for significant periods of time--we're talking thousands thousands of hours? Tthose those parts of their brain activate much, much less. What was once a hotbed of activity, now becomes relatively calm. And the other parts of the brain that tend to activate together with the amygdala, they tend to activate less strongly, or not at all.  

#### Powering Up The Prefrontal Cortex
And there's another big change that happens and that happens in your prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is the home to your awareness, to your consciousness. When you think "this is me", that's often the prefrontal cortex doing the sensing. When you have thoughts, a part of you is observing those thoughts. The home of the observer is in the prefrontal cortex. 

So what happens when you meditate for a long time is that activity in your prefrontal cortex goes up. 

And actually connectivity from the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala goes up as well. You see, you become more aware of this lizard brain of yours. And you're able to exert a greater degree of regulation over it. 

And the activity in the other parts of your brain goes up as well in response to activity from your prefrontal cortex. So again connectivity from there to everywhere else goes up. 

This is sort of like the bigger muscles of meditation. You could see on an MRI machine that yes changes are happening. But the point is not to get bigger muscles, the point is to be more effective at our sport, which in our case is inner-work.

It's good seeing you this time. Until our next session. Goodbye.
