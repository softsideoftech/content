# Feelings and Responsibility
![](https://d235962hz41e70.cloudfront.net/king-piece.jpg)

Hey there. I'm glad you're back. 

I was going talk about something else today, but instead I'm going to tell you that right now I'm feeling hurt... like I don't matter. Like I'm worthless or irrelevant. 

At least there's a part of me that's feeling that. I'm in touch with that part. 

I was getting ready to record this video and my wife let me know in passing, "Oh by the way, I made some plans this evening.". 

I was taken aback because I was planning on doing some coaching calls during that time. What the hell happened? 

I was frustrated at her and feeling sorry for myself. "Oh man. Now I'm in a bad mood. I was going to record a video. Now I'm not in the right mood to record a video!" 

I'm recording anyway because I want you to see this. And I think there's a point here. 


#### Our Core Wounds
The point is this is _my stuff_. This is my hurt. My wife is not responsible for my feelings. 

And there's some part of me that feels in these ways. 

Her actions were relatively minor in the big scheme of things. And yet I had this powerful reaction. And partly it's because I'm very open to my wife. And the things she says and she things she does really cuts right through me, down to my core, and to my core wounds. 

And that's something we all carry. We all carry these core wounds. 

And we feel like we're not worthy. We're unlovable. Or that there's something inherently wrong with us. We're shameful in some way. We're stupid. 

Whatever it might be, we're usually not in touch with these things. And in fact, we do such a good job of not being in touch with these things, that we don't know they exist most of the time until someone says or does something. And then often what we do is we get frustrated. Or we get anxious. We try to control the situation. Control is a really common reaction. And those are the things that we do in order not to feel the pain of these core wounds. 

But they're there. And they get triggered from time to time. 

They're a part of who we are. If we deny that, then it's very easy to get stuck in our stories. Stuck in the inner critic that we talked about before: "Oh this person is wrong! And this is how they're wronged me!" 

And actually, that's our inner critic's way of trying to help us not feel the pain of some very old wounds that we're carrying. 

#### Taking Responsibility
It's going to take a long time to learn how to be with those wounds and work with those wounds. And the various meditations and reflections that I'm offering you will will take you a part of the way there. 

But a big part of the way there--which at some level was a decision that we have to make--is taking responsibility for our emotions. 

When we feel a certain way, it is not because someone else did something to us. It's because this is how we feel. And yes someone does something or says something and it triggers something within us. But that's something is already within us. 

And acknowledging "Oh, this is within me", and accepting responsibility for how we feel and not blaming others--that is one of the key moves in developing yourself as a leader. Because at the end of the day, if you're the leader, blame doesn't get you anywhere. 

Blaming your team, your colleagues, yourself--that won't move forward. That would just blind you from looking at things more deeply and doing what needs to be done in order to move things forward. 

In my case, I need to acknowledge that I had these wounds right now. And be with them. And at some point I'll be able to move past them. 

And maybe through maybe years of work I'll be able to heal all of them as well. 

That's the takeaway for today. 


#### Reflection
What are the different ways that you get triggered? When do you get anxious or frustrated? Try to control the situation? Be envious or jealous? 

And what isn't the pain that those feelings are actually covering up for you? 

See If you can sorta tune into that pain. As you start taking responsibility for how you feel, notice where it's coming from. 

Well that's it for today. 

And next time we'll get back to our regularly scheduled program. Take care everyone.
