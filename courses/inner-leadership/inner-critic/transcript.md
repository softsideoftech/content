# The Inner Critic
![](https://d235962hz41e70.cloudfront.net/pointing-finger.jpg)

Welcome back. Today I'm going to tell you about something called the Inner Critic. This is a part of our personality that we all have. And if we're not aware of it, and take careful measures to manage it, it will manage us. 

It could very easily derail this entire program that you're in. And it can derail other parts of your life: things you care about, people in your life, your relationships. 

You might have even noticed the inner critic coming up already in your meditations. The inner critic--also known as the judge or as Freud called it, the super ego--is the part of us that just assesses whether things are good or bad, right or wrong, and sometimes strong or weak. 

#### What It Feels Like
There is often a kind of a sharp sharp edge to it that sometimes comes out as a mild frustration or full blown anger or even rage. And the way it often makes us feel--this is something you start to notice with practice over time--whwn we direct it at ourselves or if someone else directs their critic at us, we often feel this sense of "Ugh. There's something wrong with us." Maybe we feel like we're worthless or unlovable or simply "I don't feel good about myself." And that's often the inner critic in action. 

As you've been doing the meditation, you might have noticed the inner critic part of you coming out. If you've ever had thoughts like "Oh man, I'm not doing this right." Or "This is stupid." Or "What's the point??". 

It often has this disdainful quality to. "I'm just think wasting my time!" Or "This person is just wasting my time!" Or "Why would anyone think that??". 

Those kinds of thoughts are often not quite so emphatic. But you can still sense them. 

For many of us we can literally hear a voice in our heads that comes out in a somewhat judgmental way. It could be the voice of our parents, almost like a nagging. Like "Oh you know better. Go do what you're supposed to do.". 

It could be someone we've dated or our significant others. We hear them saying, "Oh, you should go put your dishes away." And we conjure up an image of another person sometimes. But it's actually us. It's our inner critic. And It's our thoughts that are taking us off in these directions. 

#### Practice Noticing 
So the practice for this week is as you're meditating and you have these thoughts and the inner critic part of you comes up, maybe just acknowledge it, "Oh, inner critic." And go back to your breath. 

It's OK if you don't. Maybe you have a inner critic thought and you say, "Just a thought." And you go back to your breath. That's fine too. 

What you don't want is to turn what you're trying to do with your meditation--what you're trying to do with this course--as yet another thing that your inner-critic is going to beat you up over. Because it could easily become something like, "Oh man! I just really sucked at noticing my inner critic today!" You kind of see what's going on there? That's what we're trying to notice. "Oh, OK... My inner critic is beating me up... I'll go back to my breath." 

And it's actually a useful practice for life. For me, my inner critic comes up most when I'm in some kind of disagreement with my wife. She's frustrated at me. I'm frustrated her. I just generally get this sense of frustration. Like, "Why do you have to be this way? Why can't you just see things my way" Don't you see I'm trying to help you?". 

When I'm in that inner critic state all I could think about is arguments for all the different ways in which I'm right and that doing everything appropriately. And my wife, or the other person interacting with--they just doen't quite get it. And here all these subtle ways or specific ways in which to be really helpful for me to get them to understand. "If only they can understand these things, then they'll be OK. They won't be wrong anymore!" 

That doesn't work. 

#### It's Persistent, So You Must Be Too
If you've ever butted heads of people, that's often when the inner critic comes up. And when it's one inner critic arguing another, you're just not going to get anywhere. 

So the move I like to do is exactly the move I I'm asking you to do in meditation. Noticing. 

"Oh... here's my inner critic. Just go back to my breath... Go back to my breath." 

And often it can take a while because it can be pretty persistent and just keep coming up. Before I know it, I'm back to arguing and explaining why I'm right the other person's wrong... I'll go back to my breath... 

Just noticing how my body feels can be helpful. Maybe I'm noticing some tightness in my chest that comes up during those moments. 

And that's really all we can do until we find ourselves grounded again. Because when we make decisions from the inner critic or when we act towards others from the inner critic, it necessarily leads to some kind of destruction. 

#### Going Deeper
This is actually very gentle practice that I'm offering you, starting to notice this part of ourselves that we all have. 

It's important we do it now. Because as we do more practices there is going to be more and more opportunities for the inner critic to derail our work. 

We won't be able to get to those deeper places unless we learn to notice that it's coming up for us and learn how to just disengage from it. 

We'll be talking more about this as well in person as well, when we have our live calls. 

Until then. Good luck with the practice.
