### Why Do We Meditate?
Welcome. So we're going to kick off the course with our very first practice. Today we're going to talk about meditation. 

I'm hoping you will take away two things from this. One, why on earth am I asking you guys to meditate? And two, how to actually do it. And then later on we'll talk about how it works and why it works. 

So first the why. Why meditate at all? 

Meditation is kind of like the weightlifting of inner work. If you look at a pro athlete, they are always weightlifting throughout the offseason. Sometimes during the season. 

Why? It's not because they care so much about good looking muscles, which I'm sure they also do. It's because being stronger and fitter helps them be successful at their sport. 

And meditation is the weightlifting of our sport. It's the weightlifting of inner-work. 

#### Training For Who You Really Are
You're going to get a lot out of meditation. But mostly, you're going to get two things. The first one is this: There is a part of you that has thoughts. And there's a part of you that observes the thoughts. Because how else would you know you're having them? Meditation is training for the Observer. 

You start to notice that who you are--the observer--is actually separate from the thoughts and the feelings and experiences you have. And that separation process is what is called dis-identification. 

It allows you to look at that stories that you're telling yourself, look at the experiences that you're having, and start to notice how much of that you're kind of inventing yourself. And how much of it is actually your objective reality. Which is a whole other conversation that we'll get into later. 

#### Being With Discomfort
The other part of meditation is learning to be with discomfort. Because, actually, a lot of what we're going to be doing is uncomfortable. 

A lot of our day to day experiences, the thoughts that we have about ourselves, about our loved ones, can be really uncomfortable. And we're learning just to be with that discomfort without needing to change it or modify it or re-educate or any of those things. Just experience it and accept it as "OK, this is my reality." That is the second biggest thing you're going to get out of meditation. 

#### Leadership And Integrity
We're going to go into both of these quite a bit more over time. But why do you need these in order to develop yourself as a leader? 

Well if you want to be leading from within that means leading from a place of groundedness, of calm, of authenticity--really who you are. And the more you're in touch with who you are--the more you're in touch with your objective reality--the more you can project that out towards the people around you and act from that place, from a place of honesty and integrity. 

So now I'll get into how we do actually do it. 

#### Sitting
It's actually a very simple process. You sit in a chair, kind of like how I'm sitting now. You sit upright. You don't be straining yourself, but you do want your chest open and your back straight. You want your feet planted flat on the ground. 

And what I'd like to do is gently rock side-to-side just to make sure that I'm evenly balanced on both of my sitting bones. And then rock forward and back until the rocking slowly naturally comes to a stop. 

Right now I'm pretty pretty centered physically. My head, my chest, and my hips are all vertically aligned. 

#### Breathing
And then I like to close my eyes. When you're starting off, it might be OK to just have a soft focus in front of you. But over time, you can learn to just do it with your eyes closed. 

Take a few deep breaths. Feel the breath going in and out of your body. No need to force it. Just notice the breath. Notice it going into your lungs. Going out of your lungs. Maybe your chest rises and falls a little bit. See if you can feel the air moving past your throat through, your nose. And just stay with your breath. 

#### Noting
Inevitably, thoughts are going to start coming up. And that's OK. 

As the thoughts come up, the point is not to avoid them. You don't need to fight them or push them away. 

I like to acknowledge to myself "oh, I'm having a thought" or "oh, that's a thought." And then very gently, I bring my attention back to my breath. And that's what you do. 

I also mentioned this is a training discomfort. This may be very uncomfortable. Maybe it'll physically hurt because your back is aching or your butt is hurting from sitting in a uncomfortable chair. Maybe you're having anxiety or some kind of internal discomfort. 

As long as none of these discomforts are totally overwhelming, just acknowledge them like you would a thought: "Oh my back is hurting. OK, I'll go back to my breath." Or, "Oh, I'm really anxious. I feel this kind of intense uncomfortable butterflies in my stomach or my chest. OK, I'll go back to my breath." 

#### Daily Practice
And that's going to be the practice for today. What I encourage you to do--and this is our first week of practice in our course--is meditate for five minutes every day. 

I like to meditate the very first thing in the morning. I roll out of bed, pour myself a glass of water, and sit my butt down before anything else comes up. Before I check my phone, because that often gets my mind mount my mind racing. And that makes it much harder to do the meditation. Before I check any e-mail. Before I have any conversations with anyone. For me it's easy because I on the first person to rise at home. So before the kids, before my wife is up, I'm just meditating in the morning. 

If that doesn't work find another time, ideally early in your day. Ideally it's the same time or approximately same time every day. It will be much easier to maintain that space for yourself and to establish a habit that you can keep going for the duration of this course. 

This is the foundational exercise for the course. Everything else are going to be doing for the next three months is going to build off of this. A lot of the deeper inner work you're going to try to do may be difficult or impossible if you haven't been meditating every day all along the way. 

#### Be Well
We're going to talk about this next week when we all connect in person. 

So good luck. And if anything comes up for you before our live conversation. Feel free to shoot me an email. I'm a human being. I'll talk to you. We can even schedule an urgent one on one appointment if something's coming up for you. 

 So that's that for today. Until next time. Goodbye.
