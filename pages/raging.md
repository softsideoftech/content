Stacya and I had gotten a babysitter and went out on a date. We were seated in the grand hall of a three-hundred-year-old building that was turned into a restaurant. While we were waiting for our drinks, I said something to her that she found frustrating. I can't remember what now. For some reason, I couldn't stand to see her frustrated at me over something so minor and I blurted out something cold and harsh. In seconds, we were both worked up and Stacya suddenly stood up an announced she was leaving. This was not something she'd normally do. But given my recent behavior towards her, she was being quite rational.

In an instant, an overwhelming energy rushed through my whole body, particularly my chest, face, and arms. It was accompanied by violent thoughts of all kinds: cursing at her as she walked away, flipping our table over, jumping to my feet with such force that my chair would fly back--anything to get the energy out. The only thing that saved us from embarrassment was the fact that we were in a public place and some part of me cared enough about public tranquility to hold my rage on the inside.     

This was actually a huge improvement over how I had behaved in recent months. I now remember this day as a positive turning point for my relationship with Stacya. 

This is the story of how I got reacquainted with my rage and learned to be with it in peace, sort of.
