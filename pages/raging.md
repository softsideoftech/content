# Working With My Rage

Stacya and I had gotten a babysitter and went out on a date. We were seated in the grand hall of a three-hundred-year-old building that was turned into a restaurant. While we were waiting for our drinks, I said something to her that she found frustrating. I can't remember what now. For some reason, I couldn't stand to see her frustrated at me over something so minor and I blurted out something cold and harsh. In seconds, we were both worked up and Stacya suddenly stood up an announced she was leaving. This was not something she'd normally do. But given my recent behavior towards her, she was being quite rational.

In an instant, an overwhelming energy rushed through my whole body, particularly my chest, face, and arms. It was accompanied by violent thoughts of all kinds: cursing at her as she walked away, flipping our table over, jumping to my feet with such force that my chair would fly back--anything to get the energy out. The only thing that saved us from embarrassment was the fact that we were in a public place and some part of me cared enough about public tranquility to hold my rage on the inside.     

This was actually a huge improvement over how I had behaved in recent months. I now remember this day as a positive turning point for my relationship with Stacya. 

This is the story of how I got reacquainted with my rage and learned to be with it in peace, sort of.

## My First Rage

The first and last time I was in a state of uncontrolled rage, I was 10 years old and had just moved to a new elementary school. We were on a 3-day overnight trip to a ranch to learn about farm life and build some independence. By the last day, I was worn down and feeling a deep sadness. I felt hopeless and was crying to myself on an off. After a while, one of my classmates, probably the sweetest girl there, came up to me and tried to cheer me up. 

> I feel an anxiety in my stomach as I write what happened next. A part of me is afraid to share what I did next. 

I couldn't stand her. I wanted her to be gone. But she saw through my pain and wanted to be there for me. I had an overwhelming energy rush through me and all I wanted to do was annihilate her. I lunged at her and clawed at her arm. I wanted to hurt her. She was taken aback, but it wasn't enough for me. I went at her again. This time I scratched her so hard she was three streaks of shiny red on her arm. I drew blood. 

I was satisfied and simultaneously horrified by what I did. I backed away against a wall somewhere and cried inconsolably. Everything is hazy after that.

The next thing I can remember from those days happened the next day back at school. I could sense there was something terribly wrong. Almost no one would look at me. And the few that did gave me scowls.

Later that day in science class, my usual partner and best friend at the school refused to work with me. With disgust in his voice, he said he couldn't believe he was friends with me. He never wanted to talk to me again. And he didn't.

For my last two and a half years of elementary school, I was a pariah. No one would be my friend. I would be constantly excluded. And if I managed to get into a group game, everyone would jeer at me, chanting for me to lose or get out. Even new students that joined the school, who I had no history with, would quickly pick up on my status and cast me aside.

## Coping

And so I learned to repress. I learned not to feel the pain of being so completely ostracized. I learned to never let myself experience anything intensely so I could avoid getting worked up and do something that I would forever regret. After a while, it became habit--an instinct.

For the next 25 years, my lifeforce was dialed low. I would rarely feel particularly sad or scared or angry. And I would rarely feel much excitement or joy. Starting in my teens, I drank heavily almost every weekend just so I could melt my icy guard a bit and actually feel something. It helped at first. But after a while, my inner coolness would survive even a whole bottle of vodka.

By my 20's, I had figured out that I wasn't able to enjoy life as much as others and I had resigned myself to that fate. Intellectually, I realized that I was repressing all the time. But I usually felt "fine" and rarely thought much of it.

By my early 30's, I was starting to look increasingly successful on paper. I was married to a sweet, beautiful woman. I had two lovely little girls. I had money and status and power over teams of engineers. What more could I want?

Yet I felt increasingly empty inside. I suspect I always had that sense of emptiness. But I was always working on improving my life and had made steady progress year after year. And having achieved so much, I was running out of plausible ideas of what else to improve. And so the emptiness came up more than ever. 

I wanted to get my joy back. I had memories of it from when I was little. But I didn't know where to start. And my ego continued to want to improve my lot somehow. So whatever I did, it would have to somehow give me a great sense of achievement that would be externally recognized.  

I had heard from my friend and colleague, Barzel, of this coaching program called New Ventures West. He claimed it helped him grow on a personal level. And I saw what it did for him at work. He became a manager-coach. People loved him. They sought out his wisdom and guidance. A part of me was envious and wanted that for myself.

So when I was 33, five years after Barzel did his coaching program, I also enrolled. Little did I know that I was re-opening my pandora's box. 

## Waking Up

On multiple occasions, the NVW faculty brought me to tears in our one-on-one coaching sessions. These weren't a couple watery drops down my cheeks. These were of the sobbing, shaking, and face drenching variety. With a few short conversations, they helped me see parts of myself that I had disowned and forgotten. I briefly re-experienced the pain of my past and was able to have compassion for my young, hurting self at the same time. 

I was never quite the same.

Immediately after getting back from my first 4-day NVW session, I started having [emotional conflicts with my boss](/the-safety-bubble) at work and with my wife at home.

After living with a thick skin for so long, I was suddenly sensitive to the slightest judgment. A little nagging comment about putting away the dishes could send me reeling. And it seemed to be getting worse. 

A year after starting NVW, I got into a fight with Stacya (over what, I don't know) and I quickly became overwhelmed. This was happening about once a month for the last few months. This time I became so engaged that my uncontrollable impulse to wreck something was just that, uncontrollable, just like it was when I was 10-years old.

I shoved our 200-pound kitchen table so hard that everything sitting on it flew off to the floor. Our teapot shattered and I strained my shoulder and it still wasn't enough. I swung my leg to kick something that had fallen off. I missed whatever I was aiming for and the force of my leg lifted me off the ground and I fell onto my butt.

It was so ridiculous that both Stacya and I wanted to laugh. I was calm now, but too embarrassed at my behavior to try to make up. So I pretended to hold onto my anger and stormed off to a cafe for the afternoon.

Stacya was scared. She was putting up with my behavior and getting increasingly resentful about it. Obviously, this wasn't ok, but I didn't know what to do. It really felt as if I had no "higher function" when I was in these states. And they seemed to be getting more frequent.

What really bothered both of us was the effect it might have been having on our girls. They were usually in another room, but I'm sure they could still hear it. 

My older daughter started telling me that she's worried we might get a divorce. It seemed like a ridiculous idea to me and I was surprised that she would think such a thing. Of course, she's known kids at school with divorced parents and I was giving her plenty of reasons to fear it.
