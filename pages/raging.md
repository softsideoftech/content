# Working With My Rage

Stacya and I were out on a date. We were seated in the grand hall of a three-hundred-year-old building that was turned into a restaurant. While we were waiting for our drinks, I said something to her that she found frustrating. I can't remember what now. For some reason, I couldn't stand to see her frustrated at me over something so minor and I blurted out something cold and harsh. 

In seconds, we were both worked up and Stacya suddenly stood up and announced she was leaving. This was not something she'd normally do. But given my recent behavior towards her, she was being quite rational.

In an instant, intense energy rushed through my entire body, particularly my chest, face, and arms. All kinds of violent possibilities raced through my mind: cursing at her as she walked away, flipping our table over, jumping to my feet with such force that my chair would fly back--anything to get the energy out. 

The only thing that saved us from embarrassment was the fact that we were in a public place and some part of me cared enough about public tranquility to hold my rage in.     

And this was a huge improvement over how I had behaved in recent months. I now remember this day as a positive turning point for my relationship with Stacya and my rage. 

This is the story of how I got reacquainted with my rage and learned to be with it in peace.

## My First Rage

The first time I was in a state of uncontrolled rage, I was 10 years old and had gone on a 3-day overnight with my elementary school. By the last day, I was worn down, feeling hopelessly sad, crying to myself on and off. After a while, one of the sweetest girls in the class walked up and tried to comfort me. 

>> _I feel anxiety in my stomach as I write this. A part of me is afraid to share what I did next._ 

She saw my pain and wanted to be there for me, but for some reason I wanted her to be gone. In that moment, I hated all love and goodness in the world and I couldn't bear her presence.

I had an overwhelming energy rush through me and all I wanted to do was annihilate her. I lunged at her and clawed at her arm. I wanted to hurt her. She was taken aback, but it wasn't enough for me. I went at her again. This time I scratched her so hard she had three streaks of shiny red on her arm. I drew blood. 

I was satisfied and simultaneously horrified by what I did. 

The next day back at school, I could sense there was something terribly wrong. Almost no one would look at me. And the few that did gave me scowls.

When I came up to my best friend, he turned to me with disgust. He said couldn't believe he was ever friends with me. He never wanted to talk to me again. And he didn't.

For my last two and a half years of elementary school, I was a pariah. No one would be my friend. I would be constantly excluded or jeered at if I managed to get into a group activity. Even new students that joined the school would quickly pick up on my status and cast me aside.

## Coping

And so I learned to repress my emotions to avoid the pain of being ostracized. 

I learned to never let myself experience anything too intensely so I could avoid getting worked up and accidentally do something that I would forever regret. After a while, it became habit--an instinct.

For the next 25 years, my lifeforce was dialed low. I would rarely feel particularly sad or scared or angry. And I would rarely feel much excitement or joy. Starting in my teens, I drank heavily almost every weekend just so I could melt my icy guard a bit and actually feel something. It helped at first. But after a while, my inner coolness would survive even a whole bottle of vodka.

By my 20's, I had figured out that I wasn't able to enjoy life as much as others and I had resigned myself to that fate. Intellectually, I knew that I was repressing all the time, but I usually felt "fine" and rarely thought much of it.

By my early 30's, I was starting to look increasingly successful on paper. I was married to a sweet, beautiful woman. I had two lovely little girls. I had money and status and power over teams of engineers.

And yet, I felt increasingly empty inside. I suspect I always had that sense of emptiness. But I was constantly working on improving my life and had made steady progress year after year, which kept my mind off it and gave me hope that things would get better someday. 

After having achieved so much, I was running out of plausible ideas of what else to improve. And so the emptiness came up more than ever. 

I was starting to realize that more accomplishments wouldn't make me feel any fulfilled. And I was less and less content being just "fine". I wanted to get my joy back. I had memories of it from when I was little. But I didn't know where to start.

I had heard from my friend and colleague, Barzel, of this coaching program called New Ventures West. He claimed it helped him grow on a personal level. And I saw what it did for him at work. He became a manager-coach. People loved him. They sought out his wisdom and guidance. 

A part of me was envious of Barzel. After seeing him develop himself and help so many people, I believed that being a loving leader and coach for others was the best chance for my own fulfillment.

So when I was 33 years old, I enrolled in the New Ventures West year-long coaching program. Little did I know that I was opening a pandora's box. 

## Waking The Beast

On multiple occasions, the NVW faculty brought me to tears in our one-on-one coaching sessions. These weren't a couple of watery drops down my cheeks. These were of the sobbing, shaking, and face drenching variety. Within a few short conversations, I started to see parts of myself that I had long disowned and forgotten. I had re-experienced the pain of my past and was able to have compassion for my young, hurting self. 

>> _And I was never quite the same._

Immediately after getting back from my first 4-day NVW session, I started having [emotional conflicts with my boss](/the-safety-bubble) at work and with my wife at home.

After living with a thick skin for so long, I was suddenly sensitive. People would speak to me in the ways they always had before. But now I'd pick up on the slightest judgment in the tone of their voice and I'd be reeling. 

And it seemed to be getting worse. 

About a year after starting NVW, I got into a fight with Stacya (over what, I don't know) and I quickly became overwhelmed. 

This had been happening about once a month for the last few months. This time I became so enraged that my uncontrollable impulse to wreck something was just that, uncontrollable, just like it was when I was 10-years old.

Out of nowhere, I shoved our 200-pound kitchen table so hard that everything sitting on it flew off to the floor. Things shattered and I strained my shoulder and it still wasn't enough. I swung my leg to kick something that had fallen off. I missed whatever I was aiming for and the force of my leg lifted me off the ground and I fell onto my butt.

It was so ridiculous that Stacya laughed. I was calm now and almost laughed myself. But I was too embarrassed at my behavior to try to make up. So I pretended to hold onto my anger and stormed off to a cafe for the afternoon.

Stacya was angry. She had been putting up with my behavior for months at this point and was getting increasingly resentful about it. 

Obviously, this wasn't ok, but I didn't know what to do. It really felt as if I had no "higher function" when I was in these states. And they seemed to be getting more frequent.

What really bothered both of us was the effect it might have been having on our girls. They were usually in another room when we fought, but I'm sure they could still hear it and they could definitely sense the aftermath. 

My older daughter started telling me that she's worried we might get a divorce. It seemed like a ridiculous idea to me and I was surprised that she would think such a thing. Of course, she's known kids at school with divorced parents and I was giving her plenty of reasons to fear it.

## Taking Responsibility

Despite all the emotional damage I was causing, I didn't really believe that there was anything wrong with what I was doing. I mean, I couldn't help it, right? And if I had no control, then what's the point of beating myself up over it by labeling it as "bad" or "wrong"?

I remember feeling that Stacya's contribution to these situations was something like 60%. So when we started couples therapy, I was looking forward to our therapist helping her see that. Except the conversations didn't quite go that way.

As I brought up Stacya's role in our fights, I became increasingly forceful with my voice, posture, and emotions. It was as if I could energetically force Stacya to open up to my point of view.

Kindly, gently, our therapist helped me notice what was going on. This happened repeatedly and I slowly started to notice my aggression.

For the first time, I was opening up to the possibility that maybe I was contributing far more to our fights than Stacya. 

Finally, she made a point that landed firmly on me: 

>> _My behavior was not OK. Venting my aggression on Stacya was never acceptable._

Even though I felt that I couldn't control my actions, I was still responsible for them. As obvious as that sounds to me now, it didn't make sense for the longest time.

I resolved to do better. Though I didn't know how at the time.

## Acting Responsibly

Around this time I returned to meditating regularly. I also just started going to [Diamond Approach](https://www.diamondapproach.org/) weekend retreats, which involved a lot more meditating, noticing my thoughts, and staying with my inner experience.  

And when the fight at our dinner date came along, I was newly determined and better prepared to stay with that experience. 

So as Stacya got up and left with indignation, I just sat there for a while. I may have appeared calm, but on the inside, I was on fire. I was internally shaking and needed to do something, anything.  

I did not try to shake it off by acting out the violent thoughts that were coming to my mind. I did not try to numb myself by reading news on my phone. I did not have a bunch of drinks at the bar. 

I alternated between feeling my rage--towards Stacya, towards myself --and noticing what was happening for me. How my body was flaring hot, particularly my chest, face, and arms. How I was struggling to sit still. And all the thoughts I was having about the situation.  

I could sense my desire for violence but it didn't take me over. I was able to see it without acting on it.

But I couldn't tolerate just sitting there, so after a few minutes, I got up, paid for our drinks, and walked outside.

I desperately wanted to calm down, but I couldn't. So I kept walking. And kept going from feeling angry at how unfair and unreasonable Stacya was, to feeling pity for myself, to noticing the whole ordeal in my mind and just trying to "be" with it.

Little by little, my inner tension started to relax. After half an hour, I was down to simmering anger. Another fifteen minutes and I was totally calm, though a bit embarrassed for how I acted. And so I came home to Stacya and was able to make up.

## Living With It

That was the first time since my rage came back that I was able to "be" with it without having to violently act out to return to calm. 

I've since learned that my style of energetic "acting out" is one of a handful of [survival strategies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BSU9U38/) kids inadvertently adopt as they're growing up. 

But acting out is a choice. With serious work, I've discovered that I can stay with my experience and manage my energy even when I'm feeling completely overwhelmed--which has happened a few times since the restaurant episode. 

 I'm happy to say that I'm now to be able to have emotional disagreements without getting explosive and violent. I'm grateful that my daughter isn't afraid that we'll get a divorce anymore.

Now I'm exploring what is underneath all my anger and rage. And I'll be sharing what I uncover in a future essay.
