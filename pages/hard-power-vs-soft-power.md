## Power and Authority

<b>S</b>o what should I have done? The friction between the SYMAN teams was real. It wasn't sorting itself out on its own and it seemed to me like it would only get worse. I felt a call to help the team make a shift. I just wish I knew then how to do it as leader rather than a manager, through inspiration rather than through hard power. 

I sense now that I went about it backwards. If only I had never used the power of my position to force people to do something, they would have been more likely to look up to me and hear my observations. By using the hard authority of my position, I had given up my _moral authority_, which is the real power of leadership. 

This is the kind of "soft" power that Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr had when millions of people choose to follow them. 

> By _**Power**_, I'm simply referring to the ability to make things happen in the world.

> _**Hard Power**_ is making those things happen by force or threat. 

> And _**Soft Power**_ happens when you set out on a direction and people _choose_ to either follow you or not. No force. No threats.  

A lot of power in the world is of the soft variety. People _HATE_ being forced to do anything. Even if it's something they'd choose do anyway, the moment they _have to_ it becomes a chore.

That's because hard power is fragile. The moment a leader uses force to accomplish anything, he takes away his people's ability to _choose to follow him_.

As President Trump has experienced, even with the most powerful office in the world, it's hard to get anything done if people whose actions you depend on don't want to follow you.


## The Hidden Force

Anyone with little kids knows that the fastest way to work them up into a frenzy is to make them do something they don't want to do, like put their shoes on when you're late for school. Whether you physically put those shoes on or threatened to take away their iPad time that week, it's still force. 

But the force behind hard power usually isn't so obvious. Most of the time we have no idea that we're using hard power.

That's because it's all in how the person on the receiving end takes it.

> If you ask someone to do something, and the other person feels there is an _**implied threat**_ if they don't comply, then hard power is being used on them, _intentionally or not_. 

Because if someone feels threatened, then they believe they _have to_ comply or suffer the consequences, even if those are purely imagined on their part.

Now wait a minute. As soon as I say this I think of all the people, myself included, who feel threatened in situations where there's nothing to be afraid of. We're all constantly juggling our social obligations to be polite and go with the flow and generally avoid conflict of all sorts. 

We actually experience an _implied threat_ in most of our interactions with other people. That's because when we were kids, our parents, teachers, and other authorities constantly made us do things. And when we didn't comply we'd get scolded or shamed or punished in some way.

No one gets off the hook. Even for people who thought they had perfect parents. They still had their standards and expectations for their kids, and they would feel disappointed or frustrated at them whenever they fell short. The so-called "perfect ones" are the ones that hid it best. 
 
This started early in life for us, long before we were able to make sense of what was happening. But our bodies could sense it and we would experience emotional pain about our actions. After a while, _internalize_ those standards and expectations. 

> We get _**socialized**_. We learn to act in ways that are acceptable to our parents, family, schools and society in general.

Sometimes we become aware of this force being used on us and we rebel. We adopting a set of standards that oppose the ones we were brought up with. But it's just the flipside of the same thing.

Every single person has these standards and expectations. We all have our unique sense what constitutes good or bad, right or wrong, strong or weak. Mostly we're unconscious of it. All day lone we measure everyone around us against those standards, particularly ourselves.

This constant measurement is the job of our _Inner Critic_.
 
> Whenever someone breaks one of our personal standards, our _**Inner Critic**_ directs _frustration_, _anger_, _disappointment_ or any number of negative emotions at the violator. 

Just like all the authority figures of our childhood. 

> As a society, we call this reaction _**shame**_.   









How can a leader take responsibility for everyone's psychology like that?

I would say that you can't. Not directly at least. I mean, we all try. I tried hard for years to be the "nice" and "understanding" boss. 

At every interaction I tried to be mindful of my people's emotional needs and tune my behavior accordingly.

But it only got me a short part of the way there. I minimized overt conflict, but people only gave me their conditional

But people saw through it. I tried to 

That's a challenge very few people choose to take on. 

And you can't analyze your way through it. There's no way to keep in mind and accommodate the emotional needs and desires every person around you. 

Though that's what I tried to do for years. 


But that's what it means to _**lead from within**_. You choose to take on
Well, you don't have to. That's a choice, too. And almost no one makes it.





They go along with their significant other's plans because they're afraid they'll get mad (or disappointed or hurt). Or they don't ask for

This is why trust is invaluable. As a leader, if your followers have trust in you, it means that they believe that you have their best interests at heart. They will choose to follow you
 
 as the people that follow you trust in you, and believe you have their best
