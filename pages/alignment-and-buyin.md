# I failed to reach alignment with my team and it cost me

![](https://d235962hz41e70.cloudfront.net/hurt-bear.jpeg)

<b>A</b> few years ago I was leading the data products team at Workday known as the SYMAN team. In one of my last acts as the leader, I made a mistake that shaped my management style ever since. 

I forced one of my ideas on the team. An idea they weren't interested in. And I swore to myself that I would never do it again.

I had come across a startup that was offering a continuous feedback product that I got excited about. It let people do quick and easy peer-to-peer feedback on top of the manager feedback we were already doing. It would be anonymous so that everyone would be comfortable sharing all the time. 

In less than a year, we had grown from a 20 person team to a more than 50 person “org”. I was hearing more and more about frictions between different teams within the SYMAN team. I hoped that this feedback product would shed light on what these frictions were. The people causing them needed to know. And so did the managers who actually ran the teams on a day to day basis.

I talked to the startup founder about letting us trial the product with the whole team. 

As soon as we struck the deal, I went to my leadership team, the top four SYMAN managers. I let them know how great this product was and how it was going to give us more insight into our people. We would use it as a tool to help us relieve the tensions that had been building up across their teams. 

The room got quiet.

I didn’t get the questions or excitement that I was expecting. I only saw what looked like nervous faces eyeing each other. 

We had some strained conversation about it and no one outright objected. I could tell the managers weren’t bought in.

I had conviction in my vision, so I asked them to give it shot for a month or two to see how it goes. Worst case, it’s an experiment that doesn’t work out. 

But in my mind, I could only see the best case. This product would give our people transparency into how their peers perceived them.  They would get this info in a safe and tactful way. It could even surface issues at the root of their personal development struggles. Which, of course, would be great openings for deeper conversations with their managers.

So we went ahead with it. Or rather, I did. 

The next week, I invited the feedback product founder to the SYMAN all-hands meeting. He showed us a nice demo and did his best to sell everyone on it. 

The response from the team felt lukewarm. But no one particularly objected so I took that as a good sign. I figured that people would get excited once they used the product for a while started to see the benefits.

Fast forward a couple months, most people on the team had used the quick feedback a couple times. A handful of people were using it on an ongoing basis. 

But no one was talking about it. 

I didn’t see any signs that anyone had any useful insights. No one conversations with their manager because of it. And the SYMAN leadership sounded very “meh” about it whenever I asked them. Usage trailed off over the next several months until we finally put it out of its misery and shut it down.

So what happened? 

Was my vision that out of touch with reality? Maybe it was. I don’t know for sure. But as an experiment it, I doomed it from the start. 

I undermined my power and authority with the team by trying to push something through and failing at it. Though it sounds minor on the surface, I was surprised at how painful the experience felt for me.

## Alignment & Buy-in

<b>I</b> realized that I failed because we never got aligned about what problem we were trying to solve. And my leadership team was not bought into the solution that I imposed. 

But what exactly are alignment and buy-in? 

I used to throw these buzz words around so I could feel like I was part of the "in-crowd" of senior leaders at Workday.
  
I didn't understand those words at the time. Alignment and buy-in are related--but different--concepts that I conflated for the longest time. 

Here's what they mean literally:

> If two objects are _**aligned**_, they are oriented in the same direction.

> And when someone _**buys-in**_, they are purchasing a stake in some venture (like a poker game). They are literally _invested_ in the outcome.

Now let's shift to work context.

When groups of people feel _**aligned**_, it means they share a common perspective of some situation. They still might not agree on the way forward. But they recognize the same underlying facts. And they agree on an interpretation of those facts.
 
My leadership team was definitely _not_ aligned about what problem we're solving. I wish we had we talked it through as a group. I'm guessing they would have agreed that developers one team felt frustrated with developers on another team. 
 
But what exactly was causing those frustrations? I've got my own ideas, but we didn’t have that conversation out in the open. 

_**Buy-in**_ is a whole different animal. It’s not about shared perspectives. It’s about commitment. 

When someone buys into a course of action, they are prepared to carry out that action in earnest. And they won’t drag their heels or undermine the action in any way. 

The SYMAN managers didn’t get in the way of rolling out the feedback product. But they did little to help it be successful. They didn’t spend much time looking at the metrics from the product. The didn't have ongoing conversations with their teams about it. 

Had they talked to their people at a group and individual level, maybe it would have had a chance. 

They weren’t bought in. In my rush and excitement to help them, I dispensed with this whole process. My results were about what I should have expected.

## Management 2.0
 
<b>I</b> took this lesson to heart at my very next job as [CTO of Clara Lending](/motivation-at-clara). 
 
My team at Clara would not have recognized the Vlad that would force his ideas on a team without their buy-in. 
 
As an example, the first initiative I introduced at Clara was adopting Scrum. 


While I was interviewing there, I heard a pattern in the frustrations of my interviewers. These were the execs and existing engineering leaders. I sensed that Scrum could be a solution to their problems.
 
But when I started on the job, I didn't say anything about Scrum. Instead, I took the team through a 3-step _**alignment-to-buy-in**_ process. I've used it many times since and it has worked every time for me:

- Align around our needs and desires
- Explore possible ways forward
- Plan and take action


### 1. Aligning On Our Needs
 
I took a couple weeks to speak with the engineering leaders one-on-one. I also had group meetings with the wider team. 
 
We all saw how time and again we delivered later than we said we would. Our business stakeholders were complaining about it. Some of us sensed they were losing trust in us as developers, and we talked about that too. 
 
Some developers felt frustrated with business stakeholders too. They often changed what they were asking for. As a result, the devs had to re-do and throw work away more often than they'd have liked.
 
All I did was steer these conversations to uncover our unmet needs. Both feelings and facts were fair game.
 
 
### 2. Exploring Possibilities
 
There was an offsite scheduled for two weeks after I joined. I decided this would be my chance to make a grand proposal to solve all the pains we had been talking about. Scrum!
 
I can sense the arrogance in my attitude as I say it right now: 

> "I'm the _savior_ that will solve all your problems!" 
 
Immediately, several people objected, some strongly. In my eagerness to get a "win" under my new belt, I had jumped the gun.
 
So what could I do now? How could I help the team without insisting on my way and face likely failure, like I did with the SYMAN team at Workday? 
 
Well, I heard them out. 
 
I treated every objection as valid and full of merit. For hours, we talked through their concerns. What were their past experiences and current opinions? What were their fears? How might things break down for us?  
 
It took a while for them to feel truly heard. And every second of it was worth it. 

> I could sense my influence with the team growing with every objection that I heard fully and with an open mind.
 
After all that, even the strongest nay-sayers were willing to give me the space to walk through my ideas. Though I suspect some of them were giving in to the popular will of the team to hear me out. 
 
I addressed every fear and concern. I gave nuanced explanations of how Scrum works when it's done right. I also spoke with a flavor of humility. I spoke tentatively rather than categorically. 

I couched everything as theoretical. _It might not actually work for us!_

It would not be a new dogma, it would be an experiment. We would tweak it to suit our needs as we went. And if it wasn't working, we would let it go.

> With the potential for big benefits and what seemed like a low risk, we all decided it was _**safe enough to try**_.


### 3. Taking Action
I scheduled a full day of scrum training for all the eng leaders with a great trainer I knew on the SF Peninsula. 

They all came back excited and ready to try it out. They adopted the various bits of the process, meetings, story points, etc. 

For several weeks, I attended all the Scrum meetings. I acted as the coach, offering mini-lessons and clarifications at every opportunity.

      
It took a couple of months and everyone got the hang of it. I started attending the various meetings less and less. We got to the point where I only joined in to get looped into things, not for training purposes.

### Speed Bump
I was surprised how well this _alignment-oriented management_ worked. The challenge for me was committing to intellectual integrity. I had to be open and honest both with myself and with others.

And I could not assume that anyone had a monopoly on good ideas. This was the mistake that almost derailed me at Clara.

But I left out a detail in my story. The "action" step didn't go quite so smoothly. One of our three eng leaders never bought in. His team never did Scrum quite right. They abandoned it at their first opportunity only a month after they started with it. 

This eng leader felt triggered by Scrum. He felt it was a bunch of overhead with minimal benefit. He didn't believe that the problems Scrum solved were particularly serious problems. He wasn't aligned from the start.

I thought of him as a thorn in my side and a speed bump to my first "win".
 
 > We never managed to connect. And I regret that I never cared about his needs and desires. 

I willfully got just enough buy-in from the rest of the team to press ahead and hoped he would fall in line over time.

## Management vs Leadership

<b>I</b> used _alignment-oriented management_ to get what _I desired_. And unlike my attempts at Workday, I got the results that I wanted, for the most part.

I'm left with the memory of the pain of that one Clara eng manager. 

Looking back, I can sense that he was hurting all along. The company had grown and his influence got diluted. We had more stakeholders and more interdependencies. These cut into his sense of autonomy.

His resistance to my initiative had was mostly from the pain of feeling diminished. His issues with Scrum were only reminders of that pain.

I sense now that there was another way. A way I could have respected everyone and not leave anyone behind.

It feels like my ideals of management are breaking down for me. In my experience, the point of a _**manager**_ has been to get groups of people to fulfill the desires of a select few. 

But what makes those few desires more important than the needs of everyone else? That's where leadership is different. A _**leader**_ supports the group in fulfilling their own needs and desires.

For my next few posts, I'm going to explore leadership more fully. What is it, really? And how can one develop leadership within themselves?
