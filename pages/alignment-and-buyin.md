# I failed to reach alignment with my team and it cost me

![](https://d235962hz41e70.cloudfront.net/hurt-bear.jpeg)

<b>A</b> few years ago when I was leading the data products team at Workday (known as the SYMAN team), I made a mistake that shaped my management style ever since. 

I forced one of my ideas on the team. An idea they weren't interested in. And I swore to myself that I would never do it again.

I had just come across a startup that was offering a continuous feedback product that I got excited about. This new product looked like it could supplement periodic manager feedback with lightweight peer-to-peer feedback that was ongoing and also anonymous so that everyone would be comfortable sharing. We had just grown from a 20 person team to a more than 50 person “org” inside of a year and I was hearing more and more about frictions between different  teams within my org. I was hoping that this feedback product would shed some light on the frictions to the people causing those frictions and to the managers who actually ran the org on a day to day basis.

I talked to the startup founder about letting us trial the product with the whole team. As soon as we struck the deal, I went to my leadership team, the top four SYMAN managers, and let them know about how great this product was and how it was going to give  us more insight into our people and help us relieve some of the tensions that had built up across their teams. The room got quiet. I didn’t get the questions or excitement that I was expecting. I just saw what looked like nervous faces eyeing each other. We eventually had some strained conversation about it and no one outright objected. I could tell the managers weren’t totally bought in so I asked them to give it shot for a month or two to see how it goes. Worst case, it’s an experiment that doesn’t work out. But I had a grand vision for the best case. In that vision this product gave our people transparency into how they’re being perceived and experienced by others in a safe and tactful way. It would surface the issues that were at the root of their personal development challenges, which would be great topics to discuss with their managers in a more open way.

So we went ahead with it. Or rather, I did. 

The next week, I invited the founder of the feedback product to address the SYMAN org at our all-hands meeting. He showed us a nice demo and did his best to sell everyone on it. 

The response from the team felt lukewarm. But no one particularly objected so I took that as a good sign. I figured that once people used the product for a while and we started to experience the benefits that I was imagining, they would then get excited. 

Fast forward a couple months, most people on the team had used the quick feedback a couple times and a handful of people were using it on an ongoing basis. 

But no one was talking about it. 

I didn’t see any signs that anyone had any useful insights or conversations with their manager because of it. And the SYMAN leadership sounded very “meh” about it whenever I asked them at our weekly strategy meeting. Usage trailed off over the next several months and we eventually put it out of its misery and shut it off.

So what happened? 

Was my vision really that out of touch with reality? Maybe it was. I don’t know. But as an experiment it was doomed from the start. 

I undermined my power and authority with the team by trying to push something through and failing at it. Though it sounds minor on the surface, I was surprised how painful the experience felt for me. My lessons ended up shaping my management style ever since.

## Alignment & Buy-in

<b>I</b> never got alignment from my leadership team about what problem we were trying to solve. And they certainly weren’t bought into the solution that I imposed. 

But what exactly is alignment and buy-in? 

I used to casually throw these buzz words around so I could feel like I was part of the "in-crowd" of senior leaders at Workday.
  
I didn't fully understand them at the time. Alignment and buy-in are realted--but different--concepts that I conflated for the longest time. 

Here's what they mean literally:

> If two objects are _**aligned**_, they are oriented in the same direction.

> And when someone _**buys-in**_, they are purchasing a stake in some venture (like a poker game) and are literally _invested_ in the outcome.

In the context of work, when groups of people feel _**aligned**_, those people share a common perspective of some situation. They still might not agree on the way forward, but they recognize the same underlying facts and agree on an interpretation of those facts.
 
Looking back at the SYMAN leadership, we most definitely were _not_ aligned about what problem the feedback product was supposed to solve. Had we talked about it as a group, we might have agreed that some developers on one team were frustrated with some developers on another team. 
 
But what exactly was causing those frictions? I've got my own ideas, but we didn’t have that conversation out in the open. 

_**Buy-in**_ is a whole different animal. It’s not about shared perspectives. It’s about commitment. 

When someone buys into a course of action, they are prepared to carry out that action in earnest. And they won’t drag their heels or undermine the action in any way. 

The SYMAN managers didn’t get in the way of rolling out the feedback product. But they did little to help it be successful. They didn’t spend much time looking at the metrics from the product or have ongoing conversations with their teams about it. Had they talked to their people a group and individual level, maybe it would have had chance. 

They just weren’t bought in. In my rush and excitement to help them, I dispensed with this whole process and my results were about what I should have expected.

## Management 2.0
 
I took this lesson to heart at my very next job as [CTO of Clara Lending](/motivation-at-clara). 
 
My team at Clara would not have recognized the Vlad that would force his ideas on team without their buy-in. 
 
As an example, the first initiative I introduced at Clara was adopting Scrum. 


While I was interviewing there with the execs and existing engineering leaders, I heard a number of mutual frustrations. And I sensed that Scrum could be a solution.
 
But when I started on the job, I didn't say anything about Scrum. Instead I took the team through a 3-step process that I've since gotten quite good at:

- Align around our needs and desires
- Explore possibile ways forward
- Plan and take action


### 1. Aligning On Our Needs
 
I took a couple weeks to speak with the engineering leaders one-on-one  and also had group meetings with the wider team. 
 
We all saw how we regularly delivered later than we said we would. Our business stakeholders were complaining about it. Some of us sensed they were losing trust in us as developers, and we talked about that too. 
 
Some developers were frustrated with business stakeholders too. They often changed what they were asking for and the devs had to re-do and throw work away more often than they'd have liked.
 
The only action I actually took was steering these conversation to uncover what our unmet needs were and keeping the discussion civil. Both feelings and facts were fair game.
 
 
### 2. Exploring Possibilities
 
There was an offsite scheduled for two weeks after I joined. I decided this would be my chance to make a grand proposal to solve all the pains we had been talking about. Scrum!
 
I can sense I arrogance in my attitude as I say it right now: 

> "I'm the _savior_ that will solve all your problems!" 
 
Immediately, a number of people objected, some strongly. In my eagerness to get a "win" under my new belt, I had jumped the gun.
 
So could I do now? How could I help the team without insisting on getting it my way and face likely failure like I did with the SYMAN team at Workday? 
 
I simply heard them out. 
 
I treated every objection as valid and full of merit. For hours, we, talked through the specifics of their past experiences and current opinions. What were their fears? How might things break down for us?  
 
It took a while for them to feel truly heard. And every second of it was worth it. 

> I could sense my influence with the team growing with every objection that I heard fully and with an open mind.
 
After all that, even the strongest nay-sayers were willing to give me the space to walk through my ideas. Though I suspect some of them were merely giving in to the popular will of the team to hear me out. 
 
I addressed every fear and concern with nuanced explanations of how Scrum works when it's done right. I also spoke with a flavor of humility. I spoke tentatively rather than categoraically. 

Everything saying was purely theoretical. _It might not actually work for us!_

It would not be a new dogma, it would be an experiment. We would tweak and modify it to suit our needs as we went. And if it wasn't working, we would let it go.

> With potentially high benefits and relatively low risks, we all decided it as _**safe enough to try**_.


### 3. Taking Action

I immediately scheduled a full day of scrum training for all the eng leaders with a great trainer I knew on the SF Peninsula. 

They all came back excited and ready to try it out. They quickly adopted the various bits of the process, meetings, story points, etc. 

I attended all the Scrum meetings for several weeks and acted as the coach, offering mini-lessons and clarifications at every opportunity.

      
It took a couple months and everyone got the hang of it. I started attending the various planning meetings less and less often until it was just an occational thing that simply helped me stay in the loop.

## Management vs Leadership

To do this kind of _alignment-oriented management_, we have to commit  to intellectual integrity, both with ourselves and with others.

We make an honest accounting of the issues we're facing. And we don't assume that anyone has a monopoly of good ideas--the mistake that almost derailed me.
 
But I left out a detail in my story. The "action" step It didn't go quite so smoothly. One of our three eng leaders never bought in. His team never did Scrum quite right they abandoned it at their first opportunity, a month after they started with it. 
 
There was something about adopting a highly structured process that triggered him. Maybe it's because one big point of Scrum is to satisfy the needs of stakeholders external to the team doing the work. It also protects the team from the whims of those stakeholders.
 
Why does a team even need that protection? It seemed like a lot of needless overhead to him. And compared to how he wanted to run his team, maybe it was  

> I didn't explore his needs and desires in earnest.

I could tell from the start that he wasn't comfortable trying Scrum. I willfully got just enough buy-in from the rest of the team to press ahead. I wanted to get my first "win" and figured he would fall in line over time.
 
For me, I used this management process to accomplish what I wanted. I forced my idea on this leader just like I did with my team at Workday. I just had a more clever way of going about it.

This management process was almost like a mechanical experience for me. 

> By itself, this process doesn't acknowledge that there is so much more to our human selves than our intelect.

No amount of management process can bring that forward.

So I'm not going to write about management for a while. Instead, I'm going to focus on _leadership_.  

Great leadership takes a fuller account of who were are as human beings, seeing both our needs and out neediness. 

People like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr were able to make such a big imact on the world without formal power or authority because they were great leaders,
 
There is a place for management in society, but without leadership, management is just a tool to get groups of people to implement the desires of a select few. At least that's how it's been for me.
 
Next week, I'll to try to unpack what I've learned in the last few years about the difference between Management and Leadership. And I'll point to a possible path forward to get from one to the other. 

I hope to see you then.
