# Leading From Within

You _**care**_ about your team, your family, your friends. They're the co-conspirators of your adventure. Together, you co-create things that matter, even if it's just experiences that you'll savor in your memories.

What if you could translate your _care_ for others into something more? 

You actually have it within you to bring out the most in your team and help them _**find a fulfillment at work they thought was impossible.**_ 

You can let go of _your anxieties_  
                  _your never ending todo's_  
                  _your impulses for certainty and control_  
                  
You can rediscover _the confidence_  
                   _the clarity_  
                   _the deep sense of purpose_ that's been hiding within you all these long years.
                   
                   
The first step is learning to how listen to your objective reality. 





## Missing The Subtle Cues

How many times have you noticed something was off in a meeting or a conversation with a colleague and thought something like: 

> Well, this isn't my domain, I better not butt in.
> It's probably not that important anyway.
> This is so obvious, I'm sure someone's already on it. 

We so often have important observations or insights and yet we keep them to ourselves. How often does one of the above thoughts coincide with one of these:

> Someone might get upset at me if I bring this up now.
> What if I'm wrong? It's not worth screwing up in front of people.
> They'll just blow me off, anyway.

Often we don't even notice the second kind of thought. There are parts of our mind that are constantly on the lookout for danger and they steer our actions and even the thoughts we have to avoid it. We'll come up with rationalizations like the first set of thoughts to avoid the dangers implied by the second set. 

_We usually perceive more danger in these moments than there reall is._

Over time, we can even stop noticing the elephants in the room and happily go along with the group, _"oh yeah, everything is just fine"_.


## Missing Big At Clara

When I was CTO at Clara lending, there was a sudden rise in interest rates toward the end of 2016. It was big hit to our lending business. 

That was a fact all of us knew. 

It meant less revenue for a long time to come. We also had a year's worth of funding left based on our current expenses. Another fact.  

This was San Francisco. Engineering salaries at a funded startuped were substantial. To me, these facts meant that I shouldn't be hiring any more engineers. Each hire would reduce our runway that much more.

I remember feeling down all week because I had wanted to lead a large team as quickly as possible.

So I was pleasantly surprised to hear from our CEO that he was fine with us hiring another 4-6 engineers. He believed that a larger eng team would make us more investable when the time came.
 
A rational part of me belived that was the wrong move for the company. But that part didn't get a voice because the part of me that wanted to manage a bigger team was yelling "hell yeah! let's do it!"

If anything, we should have been laying people off across the board. I promptly buried the part of me that felt anything of the sort and happily went on to hire another 5 developers.
 
Fast forward a year and Clara still didn't have enough revenue relative to its team size and funding needs. They didn't find a suitable investor and ended up getting themselves acquired instead. 

We all knew that we were trying to loft a plane whose runway ran to the edge of a cliff. And more than a few of us sensed that we were overloaded and not likely to get airborne. So how could this happen? 

Some people would call this "groupthink". That would certainly describe our behavior, but it doesn't explain it. 


## Listening To Our Hidden Motivations

The reality was we all had our own [hidden motivations](/motivation-at-clara). 

Superficially, I wanted a bigger org. I told myself I wanted to develop my management skills, particularly around scaling startups and I wanted it now, or as close of an approximation to now that I could get. 

But as I stop to notice my underlying pattern, I can see what that what I really desired was _**achievment and status**_.

And if I had somehow managed to set aside my ambitions, I still wanted to be a "team player", which really meant that I wanted to be _**socially accepted**_ by my peers. 

I was afraid to stirr up conflict and be "that guy" that got half the senior leaders pointlessly frustrated. But deep down, I was afraid of being _**rejected and ostracized**_ from the group.   



 So why did I desire achievement so much? This is where an even deeper kind of listening comes in. Its where I start to deconstruct my personality and look at the bits that it's made of.



But sometimes we do say what's on our minds and someone _does_ get upset. Or people just ignore it. Or we're wong and everyone knows it, and it _hurts_.
