I have a crazy idea. What if our authority as managers undermines our leadership? What if, by taking aways people's choice to follow us or not, we take away our chance to truly "lead" them?

When I think about some of my management "wins", have this tinge of discomfort. Like when I got the Clara team to adopt scrum, I left a fellow leader behind in the cold. He was hurting, and I was too busy with all my initiatives to be bothered.

Some of that discomfort is probably my shame and guilt. But I think a bigger part of it is the echo of the pain that I tried to ignore. 

That makes me wonder, how many times did I try to "gently steer" people toward my vision of success only to leave some of them hurting along the way?
