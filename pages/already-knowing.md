In my first week as CTO at Clara Lending, I overheard one of the execs talking about recruiting. He was going to add a $3,000 referral bonus to help juice hiring. I _just knew_ this was a mistake. I decided I was going to "help" the company by trying to stop this from happening.

Because I "knew better", I got myself into a fight with our head of recruiting, Bryce. I had almost ruined a relationship that I depended on to succeed at my job.

The fight turned out to be a gift. It forced me to let go of some of my beliefs to focus on saving my relationship with Bryce. We ended up becoming friends. Together, Bryce and I found a way for both of us to contribute our unique perspectives. We ended up being more successful than we could have been on our own.

## Fighting Over A Fantasy

I had joined Clara with an idealistic vision of what it could be. I fantasized about a warm and open culture where everyone acted from a sense of common purpose. 

> _Why would employees need an incentive to refer people in such a wonderful place? They would be helping both their friends and the company at the same time! Adding money to the mix would dirty our pristine waters._

I had read all these articles and books that touched on _intrinsic motivation_. The motivation gurus were all quite negative on bonuses. So I believed a referral bonus would kill peoples' natural drive to invite their friends to the company. 

My fantasy was threatened, so decided I would make a stand. 

Soon after the exec made the "referral bonus" comment, I pulled him aside. I asked him if we could hold off implementing his idea by a week. I wanted to have a wider conversation about it first. I intended to talk about motivation.

_This was maybe my fifth day at the company._ 

As a gesture of goodwill, he agreed. He directed me to Bryce, who had also just joined the company. She was going to run recruiting and setting up the referral bonus was her first project.

With nerves and excitement, I went over to Bryce to schedule a meeting with her about the referral bonus. I was sure that if I could only explain to her how intrinsic motivation works, she would come around. She didn't even need to fully buy-in. She only needed to hold off long enough to see for herself.

> _It's hard for me to believe that I could have been that naive._ 

Bryce had just joined. Her boss asked her to put this new process in place. It was a fairly standard practice and it was going to be her first "win". She simply wanted to get it done and move on.

But I was attached to my fantasy. All I could see was how this was going to corrupt Clara's culture and be the first tumble down a long and slippery slope. 

You can probably guess how well this conversation went. 

I'm pretty sure Bryce felt ambushed by my agenda. She was surprised that I wanted to kill her first project. She couldn't understand why I made such a big fuss over it.

 We ended up talking for what felt like an hour. I had gotten more and more frustrated as the conversation went on. I really needed her to hear me. Why didn't she "get it"? 
 
 _She was too closed off_, I had implicitly decided. I became increasingly forceful as if I could somehow crack her defenses open and she would finally "see the light". 
 
In a fit, I called her out for being closed off and "erecting a bubble" around herself.
 
 > _I had just made it personal. Bryce was hurt._ 
 
 We had a few more minutes of strained conversation before I realized what I'd done.
 
 > _I was an asshole. I needed to stop._
 
 I had lost. I had lost from the start by making it into a fight over who was right. It was too late.
 
 I relented. I told Bryce that I wouldn't get in her way of the referral bonus. And we ended the conversation with both of us shaken up over it.
 
## The Hangover
 
That night as I came out of my overcharged state, I felt ashamed of what I had done. 

The harsh way I had treated Bryce was a stark contrast to the warm and soft culture I had envisioned for Clara.

Referrals seemed unimportant now. They were never that important. 

> Relationships are what mattered. And I had to ruin one to see that.

I sent Bryce an email saying how sorry I was. And I sent emails to our two bosses fessing up to the distress I had caused her.

I imagine that a part of me would have preferred to avoid Bryce entirely to get away from my pain and guilt. But my job was building the engineering team, and I _needed_ to work with her to make that happen. 

She also needed me, as her hiring manager counterpart, to be successful at her recruiting job. 

> There would be no escape.

The next day, I gathered myself and apologized to Bryce face to face. 

## Redemption 

Though Bryce was still feeling hurt, she tentatively accepted my apology.

And then over the next several months, something that I never expected happened. 

> _Somehow, Bryce and I became friends_

At first, we were both afraid of a repeat of our first-week incident. We were careful not to get overexcited and pushy with each other.

Before too long, our plans came together and we made our first couple hires. As if by magic, our cautious compromise started relaxing into a partnership!

Here's what I think happened.

Bryce and I were both hard-charging at work. We both liked to move faster than most people were comfortable. We had track records of quick results. This may be why we collided so badly in the beginning.

Our early train crash forced us to take things slower with each other than our natural tendencies. Our fears made us more alert and more willing to hear each other out. Our fragile relationship couldn't survive one of us misinterpreting the other and overreacting.

This led to a healthy give-and-take. We came up with plans and executed differently than how either of us would have preferred to. 

We were both skeptical for a while until actually started hiring people. First one... then two... eventually five and more!

We learned that the other's ideas had value. Ideas we never thought of on our own. And so, we developed a respect for each other as professionals.

And neither took the lion's share of the credit for our wins. We celebrated together. And we commiserated over our failures too.

It was in these emotional times where we could be there for each other that our friendship emerged. 

##

For some reason, I had a certain professional distance with most of my colleagues at Clara. While we liked each other, it was hard for me to call them "friends". 

Bryce was among the few that I considered a friend by the end. My experience at work was so much richer for it. 

And I'm grateful to her for that.

Bryce, if you happen to see this one day, thank you simply for being you.
