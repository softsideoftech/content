            <p>I work with leaders who want to cultivate a deeper sense of purpose in their lives. They have
                proven their competence on many levels over their years and we meet at a point in their journey where
                their way of being in the world&ndash;that had gotten them this far&ndash;is starting to show
                its wear. They sense that there might be a different way forward that breaks off from their habbitual strategies. <br/><a href="/purposeful-leadership-coaching">Read On</a></p>

                <p>As I look back at my job at Clara Lending, I remember starting off with a powerful energy. I
                    was proud of my accomplishments in my first six months and I think others there would agree. But
                    just a year later I walked away disillusioned and demotivated with mutual frustration between me and
                    my boss, Jeff&ndash;the CEO.<br/><a href="/motivation-at-clara">Read On</a>

                <p>I remember the moment when I decided to quit my job (and career) and move with my family to
                    The Netherlands. It was a weekday night, the girls had just gone to sleep, and Stacya (my wife) and
                    I were having what seemed like a casual chat on the couch. I had had another demoralizing day at
                    work. I can&rsquo;t remember what happened, maybe it was nothing at all. <br/><a
